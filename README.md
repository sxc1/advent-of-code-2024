# advent-of-code-2024

Hello! This is a record of my [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions. I've organized each day into a separate folder with the provided `.txt` inputs and Python scripts written to solve each problem.

Each solution is unrefactored with the time to complete commented at the top (part 2 times include the time taken on part 1). If desired, I will retro-actively add refactored/explained versions of solutions upon individual request.

Happy coding!

## Personal learnings

1. I spend way more time debugging than problem solving. Don't rush implementation.
2. In addition to creating the real input file, also create a sample input file using the problem description's example input. This is easier to debug.
